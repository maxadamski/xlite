# Xlite

It's just like XML, but without the closing tags :)

Nothing new to learn, just write and edit XML and HTML quicker, even with a simple editor!


## Features

- [x] Basic XML and HTML5 output
- [ ] Optional closing tags
- [ ] Optional class and id shorthand for HTML output
- [ ] More whitespace control (maybe via xml:space preserve)
- [ ] Complete XML feature support (CDATA, !ELEMENT, ...)
- [ ] Editor support (right now kind of works in vscode as XML)

**Non-goals**

- Preprocessing or programming capabilities (should be done by a separate tool)
- Bracketless syntax
